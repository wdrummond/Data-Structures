# Data-Structures

Demonstrates my knowledge of the Binary Search Tree.
The Main.py file runs a list of students through a program that will insert into, delete from, and pull information on students from a Binary Search Tree.
There are three different lists of students that can be tested.
There is also a Linked List Data Structure file that can be used by slightly modifying the Main.py file.

The HashTable folder can utilize the same student files as the BST and Linked List.

Please be sure to use corresponding student files with each test. (Use all medium files, big files, etc.)
