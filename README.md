# Data-Structures

Demonstrates my knowledge of the Binary Search Tree.
The Main.py file runs a list of students through a program that will insert into, delete from, and pull information on students from a Binary Search Tree.
There are three different lists of students that can be tested.
There is also a Linked List Data Structure file that can be used.
